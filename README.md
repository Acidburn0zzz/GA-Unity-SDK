# Game Analytics Unity3D Wrapper

The Game Analytics Unity3D wrapper is a plugin for Unity which makes it easy to send game event data to the Game Analytics service for visualization. By collecting data from players playing your game you will be able to identify bugs and balance issues, track purchases, and determine how your players really play your game!

##### Some key features:

- Helps you track user, game design, quality assurance, and business events in your game.
- Options for automatically tracking level transitions, errors and exceptions, and system specifications.
- Option for archiving data when the user is playing offline. Archived data will be sent next time the user plays with an internet connection.

The code for the Game Analytics Unity3D wrapper is open source - feel free to create your own fork, or use the code to develop your own wrapper.

### Game Analytics Full Documentation
